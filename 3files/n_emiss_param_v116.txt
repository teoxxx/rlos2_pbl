threshold1: 0.815 limiting case! It is the coslosu above which the calc takes place! This selects the cells whose velocity is most ALIGNED with the cell's LOS, not necessarily the fastest velocities!

velocityfilter minimum total (length of 3D vector) velocity abs. value, above which calc takes place. Just another threshlod, this one for the length of the velocity.

reversexzaxesthreshold  this one reverses x,z , but in relation to the threshold calc. SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THE ONE ABOVE, yet remains to be seen! For now, we keep it separate, but DO PUT THEM THE SAME IN MOST CASES!

calcuanal: When equal to 1.0, it enables calculation of uanal (pion intensity, i.e. precursor quantity. 10-20 times faster than, and loosely proportional to, qneutrino, good for a quick estimate calc!)
