LOOP_LENGTH_FACTOR_FOR_TIMING_RELATED_TESTS=text_array(44)/1.0D next factor reduces overall LOS length, back in time as it progresses, in order to allow for smaller time spans to be used. LOSES FAR END OF DOMAIN THOUGH, only for studiyng near effects, such as the perp. beam test!

show_loops_switch=text_array(46)/1.0D 250419 show_loops_switch is a switch that turns on ONLY showing the loop indices. It works best when rest of comments are turned OFF, else it is LOST in the clutter, thus rendered useless.

zigzag_factor=text_array(50)/1.0D zigzagfactor multiplies endlosloop which is the diagonal length of the domain. 210419 reason is that due to zig zag, even though length is e.g. 70, counter reaches 120. And zig zag affects counter, not length! This wan not set up correctly back then! Still, it was progress. 210419 HEAVILY affects execution time! MOVE TO RLOSPARAMS TXT FILE!  210419 optimal value is where it barely reaches end of domain now it is at 1.4,, else LOS ends prematurely. If it reaches ends of domain, it BREAKS anyway.
